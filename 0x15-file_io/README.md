File I/O is one of the most important parts of programming. It allows programs to store data permanently and to read data from files. Successful file I/O means that data can be written to and read from a file, as needed. This allows programs to update their data even if they're closed and restarted, making them more useful for users.



C offers a vast range of powerful functions for file I/O, allowing developers to create and manage files on the system with ease. These functions have been around for many years, yet they remain integral components to all applications that need to work with files. For example, a basic text editor will use these functions for things like opening, reading, and writing files to create and save documents. More complex applications such as image manipulation tools use file I/O functions for things like saving images in different formats or reading special data from a file
